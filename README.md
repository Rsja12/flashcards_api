**Flashcards**
---------
Flashcards is a Single Page Application where users can create subjects, and afterwards create flashcards that belong to those subjects.

**Motivation**
---------
The motivation behind this project came from wanting to have a way to study all of the programming terminology that I was having a hard time remembering. 

**Tech Used**
---------
Rails

**Installation**
---------
This is only the backend side of this project. The frontend can be found at https://github.com/Rsja12/flashcards_client. Clone down both this repo and the frontend repo to your machine. cd into `flashcards_api`. Once there, in the terminal enter the command `rails db:migrate` and then `rails db:seed`. This will seed the database with two subjects. Afterwards follow along the installation instructions on the frontend side.
